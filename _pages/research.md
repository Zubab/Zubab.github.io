This paper examines the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on medical imaging technology, tracing the evolution of medical imaging from the development of X-ray technology in the 19th century, and describing AI’s integration into medical imaging beginning in the second half of the 20th century. This paper explores AI’s role in early disease detection, enhanced diagnostics, and streamlined workflows. Legal considerations are also discussed, exemplified by proposed regulations such as the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act and the U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act.

### Enhancing the Knowledge Economy: a Cross-Country Study of Knowledge Creation

  <div markdown="1">
We identify quantitatively, using cross-country data from the Global Innovation Index, a path through which R&D (research and development) operates to affect economic growth and development. The path we consider is one that relates to enhancing the knowledge economy. Specifically, we contribute to the literature through the quantification of the antecedents and consequences of newly created knowledge: R&D → creation of new knowledge → economic growth and development. And, we show statistically that the R&D → creation of new knowledge relationship is enhanced when businesses collaborate with universities. Not only is this collaborative indirect relationship new to the knowledge creation literature, but also it is based on the estimation of a model specification that has not previously been considered.

### Estimating Lifetime Adolescent Drinking Trajectories in the United States: A Three-Step Approach
*With Jeremy W. Bray, Martijn Van Hasselt & Carolina Barbosa*

<details>
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  <div markdown="1">
Background: Understanding drinking trajectories from adolescence to old age is crucial for assessing the long-term effects of intervention programs for adolescent drinking. This study estimates transition probabilities between alcohol consumption levels to understand the long-term drinking trajectories of adolescents in the U.S. 
    
Methods: We used Bayesian Simulation to compute transition probabilities from age 12 to 65 in the U.S. for four drinking risk levels (low, medium, high, very high), abstinence, and alcohol dependence. Estimated transition probabilities were calibrated using simulated annealing. 

Results:  Across 16 age groups, the 1-year probability of remaining in the same state from age 12 to 65 averaged 0.84 (abstinent), 0.47 (low risk), 0.31 (medium risk), 0.33 (high risk), 0.33 (very high risk), and 0.49 (alcohol dependence). The probability of remaining abstinent decreased significantly at age 21 and then increased gradually over time. People in higher risk drinking states had a higher probability of transitioning to alcohol dependence.  

Limitations: This study lacks prior data on transitioning from alcohol dependence to other drinking states among adolescents, leading to potentially inaccurate transition probabilities. Additionally, while transition probabilities were estimated by sex, other factors such as race, geography, and religion were not considered, limiting the model’s generalizability.

Conclusion: Transition probabilities for alcohol use states are essential to understanding the progression of alcohol use over a lifetime. These transition probabilities can also be used as inputs to model the long-term impacts of intervention programs for adolescent drinking.

Implications: These findings provide a framework for evaluating intervention programs and guiding healthcare resource allocation to reduce adolescent alcohol consumption.

### Alcohol Use in India During the Pandemic: The Role of Gender, Socio-Economic Status, and State Policies
*with Jeremy W. Bray, Abhishek Ghosh & Shinjini Choudhury*

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  <div markdown="1">
Objectives
    
This study investigates the change in alcohol use following the COVID-19 lockdown in India, with a focus on gender differences and the influence of socioeconomic status and state policies.

Methods 

Data were sourced from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), comprising 13 states and Union Territories, conducted in two phases: pre-lockdown (June 2019 to January 2020) and post-lockdown (October 2020 to May 2021). The NFHS-5 used a multi-stage sampling approach that was stratified by gender. The analysis included 312,101 respondents, with 128,258 surveyed pre-lockdown and 183,843 post-lockdowns. Outcome variables were alcohol use and frequency of use, categorized into abstinence, less than once a week, about once a week, and almost every day.

Results

Women showed a 0.15% decrease in abstinence (p = .006), with increases in drinking frequencies, particularly among rural women, those with no education (p < .001), and the poorest economic groups (p < .001). Conversely, women with higher education (p < .001) and from scheduled tribes (p < .001) increased their abstinence. Men showed a 1.64% increase in abstinence (p < .001), with significant decreases in drinking frequencies, especially in urban areas (p < .001), higher education (p = .002), and the richest groups (p < .001). Men in states with restricted sales policies saw an increase in abstinence (p < .001), while women in these states increased their drinking frequency. 

Conclusion 

The COVID-19 lockdown had a differential impact on alcohol use among men and women in India, highlighting the need for gender-responsive alcohol policies.

### The Diffusion of Surgical Robotic Technology
*with Albert N. Link*

<details>
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  <div markdown="1">
An understanding of the diffusion of surgical robotic technology is a contribution to the academic literature on the diffusion of new technology in itself, and also it is a precursor to effective U.S. public policies toward this burgeoning new technology.  Using patent application information from filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, we characterize the diffusion of this technology in terms of a traditional S-curve model.  We also hypothesize a theory of the distribution of surgical robotic technology, and we test our theory empirically.  Our findings are a precursor to the promulgation of public sector performance standards for the use of the technology in open surgery.
